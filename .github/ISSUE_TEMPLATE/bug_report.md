**NOTE**:
* Before reporting an issue, please make sure it has not already been fixed in a later version! Also make sure you have the latest version of **both waymoreores and trianglecore!** There are occasionally changes that **will require** both mods to be updated at the same time, or something will break!

* Don't post issues for mod versions made for Minecraft snapshots on this tracker. The snapshot versions aren't "properly" supported or tested, they are provided as quick ports (when I have the time to make them) in a "might work, mostly" basis, and those issues should rather be handled on Discord.

**Minecraft version**
Which Minecraft version are you playing on?

**Mod version and dependency version**
Which **exact** mod version are you using? Include the **full** mod file name for the development versions.
**"Latest" is not a version!!** It's ambiguous, it's a moving target, and very often the version is not *actually* even the latest available version at that time.

**Description of the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
